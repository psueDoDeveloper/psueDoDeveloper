- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m hikikomoring (might have to move to the countryside using a black eye orb now that the city is getting unfriendlier than usual & the coast is still a pipe dream)... howto create digital productions that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.tenyearnight.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c. or just abandoning the software game and marketing benefits of crypto & hemp. 
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 d3r4il3d 2 properly process coursework (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/)).
- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper2@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it (anotherday4u&mein"paradise").
