- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m interested in ... things that shouldn't be discussed on github.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... c++, managed to pretend my way through coursework.
- How to reach me ... better if u don't, but if u need help, ask for it.
