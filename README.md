- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m investi/instigating ... shootings that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.iamnotmychair.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c.(0l4, school days)
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 distracted 2 properly process coursework.
- How to reach me ... you'd have a better chance of reaching gwynn in dark souls II (fiends always on patrol nearby), & you might wanna wait till the unforgiving finish "making an example" out of me & "mine", but for now you can use this temp address: psuedodeveloper1@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it.
