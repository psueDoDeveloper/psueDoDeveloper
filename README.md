- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m observing ... how to create digital productions that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.tenyearnight.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c.(low blow, school days (tbtpovr))
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 distracted 2 properly process coursework (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/)).
- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper1@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it.
