- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m interested in ... things that shouldn't be discussed on github.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... c++, managed to fake my way through most coursework.
- How to reach me ... you'd have a better chance of reaching gwynn in dark souls II, though the shared link should have an avenue of communication available.
