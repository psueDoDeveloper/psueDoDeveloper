- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- 👀 I’m hikikomoring (though (but can be used against someone somewhere, huh?) who wouldn't like to move to a part of the countryside somewhere using a cppuwouldntwannabbu faretheewell and l'ea've simply now that the city is unfriendlier than before & the coast is still a pipe dream for prodigal squanderers of unreal inheritances)... howto create digital productions that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.tenyearnight and howto not play along without even trying (a VIP (or more) decided to give "getting taken from behind" a whole new meaning, even for forensic folk, but the truth will out eventually).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c. or considering just abandoning the software creation game, people screaming for help nearby, as well as government and military control systems for the "non-essentials"/"on our sh*t list" (for legal and valid reasons, of course, such as don't personally like em for whatever reason imaginable) and marketing benefits of crypto & hemp (better than nothing). 
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 d3r4il3d 2 properly process coursework (RIP oldays (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/))).
- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper2@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it (anotherday4u&mein"paradise").

- p.s. Always laughing @ the irony of getting bombarded for coming in last (the reward is nothing).
