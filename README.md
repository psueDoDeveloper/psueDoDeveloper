- Hello, psueDontDevelopMuch occasionally spilling the (giant (robot)) (jelly)beans(talk) AKA ranting on a personal github account here (FYI a couple social accounts pointing to this one either got compromised or deleted, so ignore their content, or not (if it's entertaining), until identified differently, i.e. only trust steam).

- I‚Äôm a recovering hikikomori, mostly because #goichisuda & #505games have been busy, (though who wouldn't like to move to a part of the countryside somewhere using a cppuwouldntwannabbu faretheewell and l'ea've simply now that the city life is costly & the coast is still a pipe dream)... but also looking into howto create digital productions that can't be bothered to discuss about on github e.g. ten(fine then, or twelve, happy?(of course not))year night, howto not play along without even trying (why wouldn't someonelses fetishes be none of your business), or vr'ing (sensoring) stan leesupporters & seth macfarlane'satirical representatives fighting against extreme healthcare while being the assumed hostages of hollandstories & gustave the crocodiles mercenaries, who're busy getting trapped in dundee's net, while the chairman informs plaque-readers that you're not considered a man till you walk along the ramparts of the G.W.o.C.), the end, since no one can beathem (doesn't mean you have to join them) #gravediggaz-(futanari)diaryofamadman(tis).

- I‚Äôm currently learning (when not being pestered) ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c. or considering just abandoning the software/content creation game (optional malware inserts are too tempting for too many), ignoring commotions (almost always a trap, can't even stop to help someone stranded on the side of the road @ night, if you value your mode of transport, ATM withdrawalimit, &/or life (after the death of your feelings towardsuch affairs)), as well as monarchal, governmental, military (not known to be the type to let evidence "walk away", let alone, let that fact be known, hence the need to take a "leak"), not to mention "unregistered" organizations control systems, that make personal space their own business (ever heard of too much "assistance" with making terrible (just an opinion, not a judgement) fantasies real? as a revenge/"return of the dignity that was taken" attempt? since when was dignity worth unreality anyway? someone who is aware of your dimensions could easily recreate you in their heads, that's called imagination, you have itoo). Either way, bystanders/smaller groups usually end up getting ignored when power struggles between such large scale organizations occur every now & then.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 d3r4il3d 2 properly process coursework (always remember the #bestdaysofourvices (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/))).

- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper6@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it, temporarily or otherwise (anotherday4u&mein"paradise").

- p.s. Thinking of chrome's incognito tabs & the irony of getting sound-projection bombarded for coming in last (the reward is nothing but still remain #greed(y)).

- p.p.s. If you feel like being polite to people with functioning senses ((s)killed by the (door)bell), fill out this mailable form : You just *insert assumed crime here* your *insert assumed possession here*. Then send to the nearest dustbin (or better yet nearest firepit) & go make the most of what's left of your life while trying to understand the concept of minding your own business (as difficult as that may be).
