- Hello, @psueDoDeveloper here,
- üëÄ I‚Äôm hikikomoring (though (but can be used against someone somewhere, huh?) who wouldn't like to move to a part of the countryside somewhere using a cppuwouldntwannabbu faretheewell and l'ea've simply now that the city is unfriendlier than before & the coast is still a pipe dream for prodigal squanderers of unreal inheritances)... howto create digital productions that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.tenyearnight and howto not play along without even trying (a VIP (or more) decided to give "getting taken from behind" a whole new meaning (nothing new under the sun), even for forensic folk, but the truth will out eventually, that's whathey're here for, but @ the same time, makes them better lawbreakers when they flip).
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c. or considering just abandoning the software creation game (malware inserts), people screaming for help nearby (almost always a trap, can't even stop to help someone stranded on the side of the road @ night, if you value your mode of transport, ATM withdrawalimit, &/or life), as well as monarchal, governmental, and military control systems for the "non-essentials"/"on our sh*t list" (for legal and valid reasons, of course, such as don't personally like em for whatever reason imaginable to those in charge) and marketing benefits of crypto & hemp (better than nothing, though as far as control systems go, imagine a mercenarial shadow organization pulling legal strings enough to make everything seem normal, while tightening their grip on global obscurity one continent @ a time, (un)real, huh?). 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 d3r4il3d 2 properly process coursework (RIP oldays (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/))).
- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper2@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it (anotherday4u&mein"paradise").

- p.s. Always laughing @ the irony of getting bombarded for coming in last (the reward is nothing).
- p.p.s. If you feel like being polite to people with a functioning sense of hearing, fill out this mailable form : You just *insert assumed crime here* your *insert assumed possession here*. Then send to the nearest dustbin (or better yet nearest firepit) & go make the most of what's left of your life while trying to understand the concept of minding your own business (as difficult as that may be).
