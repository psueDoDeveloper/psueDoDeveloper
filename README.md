- Hello, psueDontDevelopMuch occasionally here,

- I‚Äôm hikikomoring (though (what can't be used against someone somewhere, huh?) who wouldn't like to move to a part of the countryside somewhere using a cppuwouldntwannabbu faretheewell and l'ea've simply now that the city is unfriendlier than before & the coast is still a pipe dream)... howto create digital productions that shouldn't be discussed on github e.g.tenyearnight and howto not play along without even trying (why would fetishes get laid to rest, or are we all supposed to be missionaries? either way stan leesupporters & seth macfarlane'satirical representatives fighting against extreme healthcare can be the assumed hostages of hollandstories & gustave the crocodiles mercenaries, getting trapped in dundee's net, while the chairman informs plaque-readers that you're not considered a man till you walk along the ramparts of the G.W.o.C.).

- I‚Äôm currently learning ... c++, rust, unreal, solar2d, texturepacker, e.t.c. or considering just abandoning the software creation game (optional malware inserts are too tempting for too many), commotions nearby (almost always a trap, can't even stop to help someone stranded on the side of the road @ night, if you value your mode of transport, ATM withdrawalimit, &/or life (after the death of your emotions)), as well as monarchal, governmental, military, not to mention "unregistered" organizations control systems, that make personal space their own business (ever heard of too much "assistance" with making terrible (just an opinion, not a judgement) fantasies real? as a revenge/"return of the dignity that was taken" tactic? since when was dignity worth unreality? someone who is aware of your dimensions could easily recreate you in their heads, that's called imagination, you have itoo). Either way, bystanders/smaller groups usually end up getting devoured when power struggles between such large scale organizations occur every now & then.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm always looking to collaborate on ... c++, was 2 d3r4il3d 2 properly process coursework, so that ship sailed off into a C.I.'sunset, no thanks to forcible assistance (RIP #bestdaysofyourlife (p.s.(https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.nuage.souvenirs/))).

- How to reach me ... use this temp address: psuedodeveloper3@trashmail.fr . note that upon expiry it will be changed again unless there's no one left to change it (anotherday4u&mein"paradise").

- p.s. Thinking of chrome's incognito tabs & the irony of getting bombarded for coming in last (the reward is nothing).

- p.p.s. If you feel like being polite to people with a functioning sense of hearing, fill out this mailable form : You just *insert assumed crime here* your *insert assumed possession here*. Then send to the nearest dustbin (or better yet nearest firepit) & go make the most of what's left of your life while trying to understand the concept of minding your own business (as difficult as that may be).
